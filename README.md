# Student loan research

Hi! Our names are Nico, Jason, and Danny, and we wrote a nifty paper examining the factors that were most likely to result in (high) default rates on federal student loans.

Feel free to read the final paper (Predicting-Student-Default-Loans.pdf) also included in this repository. Thanks!
